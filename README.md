## Introducing PocketBoard

PocketBoard is a mobile-based DApp revolutionizing talent recruitment network across multiple parachains by integrating XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) technology, eliminating borders for seamless cross-parachain collaboration anywhere, anytime, all within the user's pocket. The core innovation of PocketBoard is to improve the cross-parachain workflow by letting both parties (recruiter and talent) to complete the bounty journey in one platform, compared to traditional cross-chain collaboration which need to jump across different platforms and networks. Now, recruiters from any parachain can fund bounties with their native tokens, while talents can opt to receive payouts in either the recruiter's native token or their own parachain token via XCM token assets transfer. Additionally, PocketBoard built-in comprehensive bounty pipeline, making the perfect place to assemble all the recruiters and talents from different parachains. 

### What PocketBoard tackles?

Traditionally, a Web 3.0-based talent recruitment network will be blockchain-native, which means that a recruiter can only reach out to talents inside the native ecosystem, and bounty payouts will only involve native tokens. This is bad for both recruiters and talent because of the restrictions on native hiring and working. If there is better talent to recruit or there is a good work opportunity in another blockchain ecosystem, the cross-chain workflow involved will be complicated and an inconvenience. 

1. Talents working cross-chain must use the recruiters' native platform. Talents must transfer back the payout after receiving it using a third-party bridge infrastructure and the required native token for gas fee payment.

2. Recruiters who hire a talent from another chain must transfer payout assets using a third-party bridge infrastructure and work on the talent's native platform. If there are any remaining payout assets, recruiters must transfer them back, which necessitates a native token gas fee payment.

To conclude, cross-chain collaboration using the traditional approach is inconvenient, prone to error, cost-ineffective, and time-wasting. Our project challenges the status quo by utilizing an XCM approach and a comprehensive collaboration pipeline.

### Why PocketBoard?
