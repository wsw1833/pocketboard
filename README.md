## Introducing PocketBoard

PocketBoard is a mobile-based DApp revolutionizing talent recruitment network across multiple parachains by integrating XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) technology, eliminating borders for seamless cross-parachain collaboration anywhere, anytime, all within the user's pocket. The core innovation of PocketBoard is to improve the cross-parachain workflow by letting both parties (recruiter and talent) to complete the bounty journey in one platform, compared to traditional cross-chain collaboration which need to jump across different platforms and networks. Now, recruiters from any parachain can fund bounties with their native tokens, while talents can opt to receive payouts in either the recruiter's native token or their own parachain token. 

### What PocketBoard tackles?

Traditionally, a Web3.0 based talent recruitment network will be blockchain-native, which means that a recruiter can only reach out to talents inside the native ecosystem, and bounty payout will only involved native tokens. This is not good for both recruiter and talent due to the restriction of native hiring and working. If there is a better talent to recruit or there is a good work opportunity on another blockchain ecosystem, the cross-chain workflow involved will be complicated and inconvenience: 

1. Talents working cross-chain need to work on the recruiters' native platform. After getting the payout, talents need to transfer back the payout using a third party bridge infrastructure and required native token for gas fee payment.

2. Recruiters hiring a talent in another chain need to transfer payout assets using a third party bridge infrastructure and work on the talents' native platform. If there is remaining payout assets, recruiters need to transfer back which required native token gas fee payment.

To conclude, cross-chain collaboration using traditional approach is inconvinience, prone to error, cost-ineffective, time-wasting. The status quo is tackled by our project leveraging XCM approach.
