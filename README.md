## Introducing PocketBoard

PocketBoard is a mobile-based DApp revolutionizing talent recruitment network across multiple parachains by integrating XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) technology, advocating the concept of "zero-borders" for seamless cross-parachain collaboration anywhere, anytime, all within the user's pocket. The core innovation of PocketBoard is to improve the cross-parachain workflow by letting both parties (recruiter and talent) to complete the bounty journey in one platform, compared to traditional cross-chain collaboration which need to jump across different platforms and networks. Now, recruiters from any parachain can fund bounties with their native tokens, while talents can opt to receive payouts in either the recruiter's native token or their own parachain token via XCM token assets transfer. Additionally, PocketBoard built-in comprehensive bounty pipeline, making the perfect place to assemble all the recruiters and talents from different parachains. 

### What PocketBoard tackles?

Traditionally, a Web 3.0-based talent recruitment network will be blockchain-native, which means that a recruiter can only reach out to talents inside the native ecosystem, and bounty payouts will only involve native tokens. This is bad for both recruiters and talent because of the restrictions on native hiring and working. If there is better talent to recruit or there is a good work opportunity in another blockchain ecosystem, the cross-chain workflow involved will be complicated and inconvenience. 

1. Talents working cross-chain must use the recruiters' native platform. Talents must transfer back the payout after receiving it using a third-party bridge infrastructure and the required native token for gas fee payment.

2. Recruiters who hire a talent from another chain must transfer payout assets using a third-party bridge infrastructure and work on the talent's native platform. If there are any remaining payout assets, recruiters must transfer them back, which necessitates a native token gas fee payment.

To conclude, **cross-chain collaboration using the traditional approach is inconvenient, prone to error, cost-ineffective, and time-wasting**. Our project challenges the status quo by utilizing an XCM approach and a comprehensive collaboration pipeline.

## Features Highlight

### 1️⃣ Recruiters & Talents Seamless Onboarding Experience

![Seamless Onboarding Experience](https://github.com/wsw1833/pocket-board/assets/69501009/7feaa0a6-3e6d-4762-b379-ebd0f81b66b5)

PocketBoard offers users the flexibility to connect their wallets to the parachain network of their choice, allowing them to seamlessly continue their journey within their familiar native chain. The platform caters to two distinct account roles: talent and recruiter. With a talent account, users can actively hunt bounties, while those with a recruiter account can post bounty tasks and seek proficient talent to collaborate with. The onboarding process is straightforward: users simply provide their general information, specify their areas of interest, link their social media accounts, and they're ready to engage. Notably, talents can effortlessly transition to recruiter status within PocketBoard by establishing a recruiter account under their existing wallet; the same applies to recruiters, for flexibility and easy management.

### 2️⃣ Comprehensive Bounty Setup Pipeline

![Bounty Setup](https://github.com/wsw1833/pocket-board/assets/69501009/785cd081-777b-48a1-97f9-23df604a9044)

Recruiters have the ability to create a new bounty listing directly from their profile. To create a bounty listing, recruiters must provide general details about the bounty, attach relevant reference materials, and designate a due date, initiating a countdown for talents. The setup process also involves uploading a proof of work badge design which is used for minting as an ERC-721 based NFT badge, to be awarded to the talent upon completion and approval of the task. Moreover, recruiters are required to specify the bounty reward amount, with the option to select the desired token assets (supported XC20) from their native chain to fund the bounty. Once the bounty is submitted, it is showcased in the bounty directories, accessible to talents within PocketBoard.

### 3️⃣ Bounty Solution Submission

![Bounty Setup](https://github.com/wsw1833/pocket-board/assets/69501009/4b162a00-9f11-4ab0-bd6d-c2619ac555a8)

Once a talent has completed a bounty and formulated a solution, they can submit it through the portal. The submission process allows the talent to include a link to their solution and leave a comment for the reviewer. At this juncture, the talent has the option to choose their desired parachain (the parachain the talent is at) to receive the bounty payout, or they can opt to retain the recruiter's native chain for payout. If the talent selects a different parachain to receive the reward payout, an XCM cross-chain token asset transfer is initiated. This process transfers the recruiter's native token asset to the talent's parachain. Conversely, if the talent opts to receive the payout in the recruiter's native token asset, it is directly transferred to the talent's native wallet. Upon submission, the solution enters the submission list within the recruiter's bounty listing, awaiting review.


### 4️⃣ Work Review System and XCM-Powered Cross-Chain Payout

![Review and Payout](https://github.com/wsw1833/pocket-board/assets/69501009/c9033c3c-52e4-459d-91ea-fbdaa86a70ff)

Talents' submissions to a bounty listing can be reviewed by the recruiter, who has the authority to mark the submission as either approved or rejected. Approved submissions progress to the next phase, where the bounty is closed and marked as completed. This entails initiating the payout to the talent, based on the pre-specified amount.The payout exclusively involves using the recruiter's native token asset. If the talent has opted to receive the payout on another parachain, as specified during the submission, an XCM cross-chain token asset transfer is seamlessly executed in the background. Notably, this transfer occurs automatically without requiring any action from the recruiter, simplifying the cross-chain process. Furthermore, the proof-of-work badge associated with the bounty is minted and rewarded to the talent who contributed to its completion.

### 5️⃣ The Proof-Of-Work Badge

Whenever a recruiter creates a bounty task, a custom-designed proof of work badge is uploaded, intended to be minted into an ERC-721 based NFT badge. This Proof of Work NFT badge serves as a reward for talents upon successful submission and approval of their solutions by the recruiter. Subsequently, the minted proof of work badge is transferred and nested into the user's ERC-7401 based NFT talent profile. All accumulated proof-of-work badges of a talent are prominently showcased in the Hall of Fame section, accessible for public viewing by all PocketBoard users.

### 6️⃣ On-Chain Reputation System: The Handshake

![HandShake](https://github.com/wsw1833/pocket-board/assets/69501009/acd675c2-c272-4f95-ac84-47872e628ab5)

Each talent profile on PocketBoard is structured as an ERC-7409-based NFT, uniquely equipped to facilitate on-chain emoji reactions. Leveraging this NFT standard, PocketBoard constructs an on-chain reputation mechanism for talents. Users across PocketBoard can search for and express their admiration or support for a particular talent by reacting with a handshake emoji. The talent profile NFT meticulously records all received handshakes, with the quantity serving as a reflection of the talent's valuation and credibility. Talents with a higher count of handshakes are more likely to be assigned to lucrative bounty tasks, further validating their expertise and trustworthiness within the community.
